In this code are one different ways  to classify the dataset Iris & Wine
Decission Tree
Na√Øve Bayes
KNN (Neightres Neghtbord)
SVM (Support Vector Machines)
DNN (Deep Neural Networks)
CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
PNN (Probabilistic Neural Networks)
Notice that most of this code is not a good practice writing code so please be carefull
Are trained in 2 different % 50/50 and 80/20 train/test
